Hi! I am Anishka, a senior year Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, India.

I am passionate about algorithms, competitive programming and software development. Besides, I have also begun to explore the world of artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning mainly) and am loving it <3.

I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and am a C++ fanatic. I also like Python and Bash scripting. I deeply respect the open source community for all the awesome stuff they build and we use everyday.

I hail from Chandigarh (India), but have spent most of my life in Kolkata, Bangalore, Bombay and a few other Indian cities, thanks to my dad's job. I am a classical dancer and also like to draw, though I've not done much after school. I am fond of traveling, shopping, music and pets. I had a lot of pet birds as a child, and I really really want to get a cat.

Okay, too much about me XD. Hope to write some meaningful/helpful blog posts in the future. Thanks for your time!
